# `D1 Q1`

# `Numerian Data Ledger`

- ## `Problem Statement`

  ### In the great Archive of Numeria, the royal scribe is tasked with recording all types of data exactly as they appear. Each entry in the ledger may contain a mix of numbers, characters, and real values - and the scribe must write down each value on a separate scroll so they can be referenced easily by the Grand Sage.

  ### Your task is to assist the scribe by reading a single line of data containing one value of each of the following types:

  - int
  - long long
  - char
  - float
  - double

  #### Then, print each of these values on a new line in the same order as input.

- ## `Challenge`

  ### Write a C++ program that reads a line containing an int, a long long, a char, a float, and a double - all space-separated - and prints each value on a new line, in the same order.

  ## Input

  ### A single line containing five space-separated values in this order:

  - An int
  - A long long
  - A char
  - A float
  - A double

  ## Output

  ### Print each value on a new line in the same order as received.

## Note: For float and double, output will be handled in standard C++ floating point formatting (may display minor rounding).

# `Numerian Greetings`

- ## `Problem Statement`

  ### In the heart of Numeria, visitors from distant lands arrive daily to see the legendary Grand Sage. As part of the tradition, each guest must be greeted personally before they enter the royal court. The Grand Sage would like an assistant to automate this process so that every name is greeted warmly and uniquely.

- ## `Challenge`

  ### Write a C++ program that reads a single name from standard input and prints a personalized greeting in the following format:

  #### Hello, name

  #### where name is the exact input provided.

  ## Input

  ### A single line containing a string, S, representing the visitor's name.

  ## Output

  ### A single line: `Hello, ` followed by the name.

## Note: Print your output exactly as specified, with no extra spaces or newlines at the end.

# `D1 Q3`

# `Numerian Calculator`

- ## `Problem Statement`

  ### In the bustling market of Numeria, two merchants meet to settle their accounts. Each has brought their tallies: the number of magical orbs traded and the number of enchanted relics exchanged. The Numerian Judge requests you to calculate the following using their inputs:

  - The sum,
  - The difference (irst minus second),
  - The product,
  - The quotient from integer division (first number divided by the second, discarding any fractional part

- ## `Challenge:`

  ### Write a C++ program that reads two integers, a and b, from standard input and prints their sum, difference, product, and quotient in a single line, separated by spaces (no trailing space or newline at the end).

  ## Note: You may assume b will never be zero.

  ## Input:

  ### A single line containing two integers, a and b, separated by a space.

  ## Output:

  ### A single line containing four integers separated by spaces, in the following order:

  - Sum(a+b)
  - Diference(a-b)
  - Product(a\*b)
  - Integer Division(a/b, discarding any remainder)

  ## Note: No extra space or newline should follow the last output integer.

# `D1 Q4`

# `Numeria's Sacred Garden`

- ## `Problem Statement`

  ### Nestled in the peaceful valleys of Numeria, the royal gardeners are preparing a new rectangular garden for the upcoming festival. Each garden must be meticulously measured to ensure both beauty and symmetry. This year, the chief gardener asks for your help:

  ### Given the length and breadth of the proposed garden, calculate both the total area that will be cultivated and the exact length of the fence required to enclose it.

- ## `Challenge`

  ### Write a C++ program that reads two integers from standard input - length and breadth - and prints:

  - The area of the rectangle on the first line
  - The perimeter of the rectangle on the second line

  ## Input

  ### A single line containing two integers, separated by a space: length and breadth of the new garden.

  ## Output

  ### Print two lines:

  - First line: The area of the garden
  - Second line: The length of the fence (perimeter)
