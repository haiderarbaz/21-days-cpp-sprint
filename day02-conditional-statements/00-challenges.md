# `D2 Q1`

- ## Arya is learning C++ and wants to create a small tool to help her younger brother with his math homework. Her brother is currently learning about even and odd numbers and often gets confused. To help him, Arya decides to write a simple C++ program that tells whether a number is even or odd.

  ### Your task is to help Arya by writing this program.

  ## `Input`:

  ### An integer entered by the user (Arya's brother).

  #### `Example`: 5

  ## `Output`:

  ### A message indicating whether the number is even or odd.

  ## `Example Output:` Odd number

  ### Even Number

# `D2 Q2`

- ## Mira is volunteering at a local community center where they're organizing a wellness program for people of all age groups. As part of her task, she needs to register participants and classify them based on their age to assign them to the right activity group. To make her work easier, Mira decides to write a C++ program that automatically classifies a person based on their age.

  ### Your job is to help Mira by writing a program that takes a person's age as input and classifies them into one of the following categories:

  - `Child`: 0 to 12 years old
  - `Teenager`: 13 to 19 years old
  - `Adult`: 20 to 59 years old
  - `Senior`: 60 years and above

  ## `Input`:

  ### A single integer representing the person's age.

  ### `Example:`

  #### 45

- ## Ravi loves solving number puzzles and recently started learning programming. His little sister challenged him with a fun problem: "Can you write a program that checks if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5?" Ravi takes this challenge seriously and wants to impress her by writing a smart C++ program.

  ### Your task is to help Ravi write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it's divisible by both 3 and 5.

  ## `Input`:

  ### A single integer.

  ### `Example`:

  #### 15

  ## `Output`:

  ### A message indicating whether the number is divisible by both 3 and 5.

  ### `Example Output`:

  #### Yes

  ## `Input`:

  #### 12

  ## `Output`:

  #### No

# `D2 Q4`

- ## Sara is designing a digital calendar app for her school project, and one of the key features is accurately determining whether a given year is a leap year. A leap year affects how many days February has, and getting it wrong could really mess up date calculations!

  ### To ensure her app works perfectly, she decides to write a C++ program that checks if a given year is a leap year or not. Now, she needs your help to make it happen.

  ### A year is considered a leap year if:

  #### It is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100

  #### `OR`

  #### It is divisible by 400

  ## `Input`:

  ### A single integer representing the year.

  #### `Example`:

  ##### 2024

  ## `Output`:

  ### Print Leap Year if the year is a leap year, otherwise, print Not a Leap Year.

  #### `Example Output`:

  ##### Leap Year
